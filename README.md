## In this repository I have worked messy datasets and have done data pprofiling using pandas python Library.
## DATA PROFILING ia a process of examining, analyzing, and creating useful summaries of data.
## The process yields a high-level overview which aids in the discovery of data quality issues, risks, and overall trends. 
## Data profiling can eliminate costly errors that are common in customer databases. These errors include null values (unknown or missing values), values that shouldn’t be included, values with unusually high or low frequency, values that don’t follow expected patterns, and values outside the normal range.
